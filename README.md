# A*PathFinding-Algo

**Getting Started**

The project is an attempt to understand the **A-starPathFinding-Algo** for my Robotics Society at NSUT, ARES. The project consists of the code for implementing the algorithm. Major inspiration for the code has been taken from **Geeks For Geeks**, with few modifications to the implementaion of OOPS and few data structures that are used. Also the Path Trace and the type of grid has been modified accordingly. The algorithm is implemented on a grid based system with best path to reach from the source to destination which includes diagonal traversal. Euclidean distance is considered as the heuristic parameter.

**Prerequisites**

An IDE or any kind of text-editor will do!

**Tests and Checking**

The grid can be changed according to the needs and size of ROW and COL can be changed according to the size of grid required. The path Tracing can be modified with the necessary character.
